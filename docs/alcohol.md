# Alcohol Widget

The Alcohol Widget displays a countdown timer for the alcohol effect in Guild Wars, helping you track how long you'll remain under the influence of drinks.

## Features

The Alcohol Widget:
- Shows a countdown timer for the remaining duration of alcohol effects
- Tracks your current level of intoxication (1-5)
- Automatically updates when you consume alcoholic drinks
- Stacks time appropriately when consuming multiple drinks
- Features a shadow effect for better visibility against different backgrounds
- Only appears in explorable areas

## Usage

The Alcohol Widget is useful for:
- Tracking the "Party Animal" title progression
- Maintaining alcohol effects for weapons that deal bonus damage while drunk (like Drunken Master weapons)
- Timing your consumption of drinks for maximum efficiency
- Keeping track of when you need to consume another drink to maintain effects

The widget automatically updates when you consume alcoholic drinks in the game, showing the remaining time of the effect.

## Settings

In the Alcohol Widget settings, you can configure:
- **Only show when drunk**: When enabled, the widget will only be visible while you have an active alcohol effect

## Tips

- Different alcoholic drinks provide different levels of intoxication:
  - Hunter's Ale, Eggnog, Witch's Brew, Shamrock Ale, and similar drinks provide level 1 intoxication (1 minute)
  - Dwarven Ale and similar drinks provide level 3 intoxication (3 minutes)
  - Firewater and similar drinks provide level 5 intoxication (5 minutes)
- Consuming multiple drinks stacks the duration, not the level of intoxication
- Each level of intoxication contributes to the "Party Animal" title track
- The widget will only appear in explorable areas, not in outposts or towns
- Position the widget where you can easily monitor it during gameplay if you're working on the "Party Animal" title
