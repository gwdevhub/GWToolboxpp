# April Fools Module

The April Fools module is a fun, seasonal feature that activates around April 1st each year. It adds humorous effects to the game to celebrate April Fools' Day.

## April Fools 2020: Pandemic Simulator

The 2020 April Fools feature simulates a "disease" spreading among players in outposts, referencing the COVID-19 pandemic that was occurring at that time.

### Features:
- Randomly "infects" players in outposts with the disease effect
- Infected players display speech bubbles with humorous pandemic-related quotes
- The infection spreads from player to player at random intervals
- Only visible in outposts, not in explorable areas or missions

### Quotes:
Infected players may say things like:
- "Happy April Fools Da-- *cough*"
- "I don't feel so good..."
- "*cough* *cough*"
- "I'm down to my last roll of toilet paper!"
- "Day 5 of self isolation..."
- And many more pandemic-themed jokes

### Activation:
- Automatically activates on April 1st and 2nd
- Can be manually toggled with the `/aprilfools` command

### Notes:
- This feature is purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay
- The "infection" is only visual and does not impact character performance
- All effects are only visible to you, not to other players

This module demonstrates GWToolbox++'s tradition of adding lighthearted, seasonal content to celebrate special occasions in the Guild Wars community.
