## Usage

The Bonds widget appears when you have at least one maintainable enchantment or refrain skill equipped. It displays a grid where:
- Each row represents a party member
- Each column represents a specific bond skill

To use the widget:
1. Equip maintainable enchantment skills
2. Position the widget as desired
3. Hover over a cell to highlight it
4. Click to cast or cancel the bond on that party member (if enabled)

This widget is particularly useful for monks, ritualists, and other support professions that maintain multiple enchantments on party members.
