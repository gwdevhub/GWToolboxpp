## Usage

To access the Completion Window:
1. Open the GWToolbox++ main window
2. Click on the "Completion" button

The window displays various categories of completion data:

1. Outposts
2. Missions
3. Vanquishes

## Character Selection

You can view completion data for different characters on your account:
1. Use the character dropdown at the top of the window
2. Select the desired character
3. The window will update to show that character's completion status
4. Characters are grouped by account, making it easy to manage multiple accounts

The system automatically detects all characters on your account and tracks their progress separately, allowing you to:
- Compare completion status across characters
- Identify which characters need to complete specific content
- Plan which characters to use for different activities

## Filtering and Display Options

The Completion Window offers several ways to customize your view:

- **Filter by campaign**: View only Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, or Eye of the North content
- **Switch between normal and hard mode**: See different completion statuses for applicable categories
- **Sort by different criteria**: Arrange items by name, completion status, or other attributes

## Hall of Monuments

For each monument, you can:

- Identify which achievements you still need to complete

## Updating Data

The Completion Window updates data from multiple sources:

## Notes

- Some data may require specific actions in-game to update (e.g., talking to NPCs for festival hats)
- You can click on missions to travel to their respective outposts
- The window provides a comprehensive overview of your Guild Wars journey and helps identify areas for further exploration or completion
