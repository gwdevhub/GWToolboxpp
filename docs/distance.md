  - Adjacent Range
  - Nearby Range
  - Area Range
  - Earshot Range
  - Cast Range
  - Spirit Range
  - Compass Range
- Features a shadow effect for better visibility against different backgrounds
- Can be hidden in outposts

## Usage

The Distance Widget is useful for:
- Positioning yourself at the optimal range for your skills
- Maintaining proper distance for area of effect spells
- Staying within earshot range for party buffs
- Keeping track of whether you're in casting range of your target
- Determining if you're close enough to interact with NPCs or objects

The widget automatically updates as you move or change targets.

## Settings

- **Hide in outpost**: Automatically hide the widget when in towns or outposts
- **Text sizes**:
  - 'Distance' header: Size of the title text
  - Percent value: Size of the percentage display
  - Absolute value: Size of the exact distance display

- Set the widget to hide in outposts to reduce screen clutter when not in combat areas
- Position the widget near your skill bar to easily monitor range while using skills
- The absolute distance value is useful for precise positioning in advanced tactics
- Remember that "Adjacent" range (0-144) is required for melee attacks
