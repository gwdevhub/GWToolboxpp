# Effects Monitor

The Effects Monitor widget in GWToolbox++ enhances the standard Guild Wars effects monitor by displaying numerical countdown timers for your active effects, making it easier to track exactly how much time remains on each effect.

## Features

### Countdown Timers
- Displays precise numerical countdown timers for all active effects
- Shows time remaining in seconds, with configurable decimal precision
- Overlays the timers directly on the standard Guild Wars effects monitor

### Customization Options

- Filter out effects with long durations to reduce clutter
- Option to round timers up or down
- Customize text size and colors

### Special Features

## Settings

### Display Options
- **Font size**: Adjust the size of the countdown timer text
- **Text color**: Customize the color of the countdown numbers
- **Background color**: Set a background color behind the timers for better visibility
- **Text shadow color**: Add a shadow to the text for improved readability

### Timer Behavior
- **Decimal threshold**: Show decimal places for effects under this many seconds (default: 10 minutes)
- **Only show effects under**: Hide timers for effects with durations longer than this many seconds (default: 1 hour)
- **Round up**: Toggle between rounding timers up or down
- **Show vanquish counter**: Display the vanquish counter in Hard Mode areas

## Benefits

- **Precision**: Know exactly when effects will expire without guessing from the visual indicator
- **Awareness**: Better track important buffs and debuffs during intense gameplay

This widget is particularly useful for:
- Players who need precise timing for skill chains

- Players in challenging areas where effect management is critical

The Effects Monitor integrates seamlessly with the Guild Wars interface, enhancing the existing effects display without replacing it.
