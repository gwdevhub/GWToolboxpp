# Extra Weapon Sets

The Extra Weapon Sets module in GWToolbox++ expands your character's weapon swapping capabilities by adding four additional weapon sets beyond the standard four that Guild Wars provides.

## Features

### Additional Weapon Sets
- Adds 4 extra weapon sets to your character
- Allows for a total of 8 different weapon combinations
- Seamlessly integrates with the existing weapon bar interface

### Weapon Set Management
- Extra weapon sets appear above the standard weapon sets in the weapon bar
- Click on an extra weapon set to equip it, just like the standard sets
- Weapon sets persist between map changes and game sessions

### Expanded Build Options
- Carry more specialized weapon combinations for different situations
- Quickly switch between multiple weapon types during combat
- Maintain separate weapon sets for different roles (damage, support, energy management, etc.)

## Usage

The Extra Weapon Sets module is enabled automatically when GWToolbox++ starts. The additional weapon sets will appear as new slots above your standard weapon sets in the weapon bar interface.

To use the extra weapon sets:

1. Click on one of the extra weapon set slots (located above your standard weapon sets)
2. Equip the weapons you want to assign to that set
3. Switch between your weapon sets by clicking on them in the weapon bar

## Benefits

- **More Versatility**: Carry specialized weapons for different situations without constantly swapping items in your inventory
- **Faster Responses**: Quickly adapt to changing combat situations with more pre-configured weapon options
- **Better Organization**: Keep your weapon combinations organized and readily available
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: Access a wider range of skills and attributes through additional weapon combinations

## Notes

- The extra weapon sets function identically to the standard weapon sets
- Weapons must be in your inventory to be equipped in the extra sets
- The module remembers which items belong to each weapon set, even if you move them in your inventory

This module is particularly useful for players who frequently switch between different weapon combinations, such as those who play multiple roles within a team or who need specialized weapons for different encounters.
