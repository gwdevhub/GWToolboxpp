# Latency Widget

The Latency Widget displays your current ping (latency) to the Guild Wars server, helping you monitor your connection quality during gameplay.

## Features

The Latency Widget:
- Shows your current ping to the server in milliseconds
- Can optionally display your average ping
- Changes color based on ping value (green for good, red for bad)
- Allows you to set a custom threshold for what's considered a "bad" ping
- Provides a chat command to share your ping with others
- Supports Ctrl+click to quickly send your ping to chat

## Usage

The Latency Widget is useful for:
- Monitoring your connection quality to the Guild Wars servers
- Diagnosing performance issues during gameplay
- Determining if lag is affecting your gameplay
- Sharing your ping with party members when coordinating activities

The widget automatically updates as your ping changes. You can:
- View your current ping at a glance
- Ctrl+click on the widget to send your ping to chat
- Use the `/ping` chat command to display your current and average ping in chat

## Settings

In the Latency Widget settings, you can configure:
- **Red ping threshold**: Set the ping value (in milliseconds) at which the display turns from green to red
- **Show average ping**: Toggle the display of your average ping in addition to current ping
- **Text size**: Adjust the size of the ping display text

## Tips

- A lower ping means better connection quality and less lag
- Ping under 100ms is generally considered good for Guild Wars
- If your ping is consistently high (red), consider:
  - Checking your internet connection
  - Closing bandwidth-intensive applications
  - Connecting via ethernet instead of Wi-Fi
  - Trying a different server if available
- Use the ping display to determine if performance issues are related to your connection or your computer
- Share your ping with party members when coordinating time-sensitive activities
