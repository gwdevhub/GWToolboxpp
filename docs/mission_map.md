# Mission Map

The Mission Map widget in GWToolbox++ enhances the standard Guild Wars mission map with additional features and functionality.

## Features

### Custom Lines
- **Draw all terrain lines**: Display custom lines that are normally only visible on the 3D terrain
- **Draw all minimap lines**: Display custom lines that are normally only visible on the minimap
- Lines created in the GWToolbox++ minimap can be displayed on the mission map

### Custom Markers
- **Place custom markers**: Right-click anywhere on the mission map to place a custom marker
- **Remove markers**: Right-click and select "Remove Marker" to remove a custom marker
- Custom markers are shared with the World Map widget

### Coordinate Display
- See the coordinates of any location when right-clicking on the map
- Useful for identifying specific locations in missions

## Usage

The Mission Map widget works by enhancing the existing mission map interface in Guild Wars. When the mission map is open (default key 'U'), the widget adds the following functionality:

1. Custom lines from the minimap or terrain are displayed on the mission map
2. Right-clicking on the map shows coordinates and allows placing/removing markers

To access the widget's settings:
1. Open the GWToolbox++ Settings window
2. Navigate to the "Mission Map" section
3. Toggle the options for displaying terrain and minimap lines

## Notes

- The widget is only active when the mission map is open
- Custom markers persist between game sessions and are shared with the World Map widget
- The widget is particularly useful for navigating complex missions or marking important locations

This widget is especially helpful for players who want to mark specific locations in missions, such as hidden chests, boss locations, or optimal paths.
