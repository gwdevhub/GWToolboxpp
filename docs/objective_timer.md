# Objective Timer

The Objective Timer window automatically tracks and displays timers for objectives in various challenging areas of Guild Wars, helping you measure and improve your run times.

## Features

The Objective Timer automatically activates when you enter supported areas and tracks:
- **Domain of Anguish (DoA)**: Foundry, Veil, Gloom, City
- **Fissure of Woe (FoW)**
- **The Underworld (UW)**
- **The Deep**
- **Urgoz's Warren**
- **Dungeons**

For each area, the timer tracks:
- Individual objectives and their completion times
- Overall run duration
- Start and end times for each objective

## Usage

The timer automatically starts when you enter a supported area and tracks objectives as you complete them. The window displays:
- A list of objectives for the current run
- The time each objective was started and completed
- The duration of each objective
- The total run time

You can also:
- View detailed information about each objective
- See past runs (if enabled in settings)
- View the current run in a separate window

## Settings

In the Objective Timer settings, you can configure:
- **Show second decimal**: Display times with decimal precision
- **Show 'Start' column**: Display when each objective started
- **Show 'End' column**: Display when each objective ended
- **Show 'Time' column**: Display the duration of each objective
- **Show detailed objectives**: Show more detailed information for objectives (currently only affects DoA)
- **Show run start date/time**: Display the date and time when the run started
- **Show current run in separate window**: Open a dedicated window for the current run
- **Save/Load runs to disk**: Keep a record of your runs in JSON format
- **Show past runs**: Display runs from previous days
- **Automatic /age on completion**: Send the /age command automatically when the final objective is completed

## Tips

- Use the timer to track your progress and improve your run times
- Compare your times with previous runs to measure improvement

- Enable "Save/Load runs to disk" to keep a record of your runs over time
- The automatic /age feature helps you get the server-side completion time for more accurate records
