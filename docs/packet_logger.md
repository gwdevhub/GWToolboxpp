# Packet Logger

The Packet Logger window is an advanced tool that allows you to monitor and record the network packets exchanged between the Guild Wars client and server, useful for debugging and development purposes.

## Features

The Packet Logger window:
- Captures and displays network packets in real-time
- Filters packets by type, direction, or content
- Allows you to save packet logs for later analysis
- Provides detailed information about each packet's structure and content

## Usage

The Packet Logger is primarily intended for:
- Developers working on GW Toolbox++ or other Guild Wars tools
- Advanced users troubleshooting connection issues
- Players researching game mechanics
- Those interested in understanding how Guild Wars communicates with its servers

To use the Packet Logger:
1. Open the Packet Logger window from the GW Toolbox++ menu
2. Configure the filters to focus on specific packet types if needed
3. Observe the packets as they are exchanged during gameplay
4. Save logs for later analysis if desired

## Settings

In the Packet Logger settings, you can configure:
- Which packet types to display or ignore
- Display format and level of detail
- Auto-save options for logs
- Performance settings (as logging all packets can be resource-intensive)

## Notes

- The Packet Logger is an advanced tool and most regular users will not need to use it
- Logging all packets can impact game performance, so use filters to focus on specific packet types
- The information displayed is technical in nature and requires understanding of Guild Wars' network protocol
- This tool is primarily for development and debugging purposes, not for regular gameplay enhancement
