# Quest Module

The Quest Module in GWToolbox++ enhances your quest experience with several quality-of-life improvements to the quest log and related functionality.

## Features

### Quest Path Visualization
- Display a path from your current location to the quest marker
- Customize where the path appears:
  - On the terrain in the 3D game world
  - On the minimap
  - On the mission map
- Paths automatically update as you move through the game world
- Paths are color-coded to distinguish between active and other quests

### Quick Travel
- Double-click any quest in the quest log to travel to the nearest outpost for that quest
- Saves time when you need to quickly get to a quest location
- Works from any outpost

### Custom Quest Markers
- Set custom quest markers on the map
- Useful for marking locations that aren't part of official quests
- Persists between game sessions

### Quest Objective Tracking
- Improved tracking of quest objectives
- Better visualization of quest progress
- Support for the `/duncan` command to check "The Last Hierophant" quest status

## Settings

The Quest Module settings can be accessed through the GWToolbox++ Settings window:

- **Double-click to travel**: Enable/disable the ability to double-click quests in the quest log to travel to them
- **Draw path on terrain**: Show the path to the quest marker in the 3D game world
- **Draw path on minimap**: Show the path to the quest marker on the minimap
- **Draw path on mission map**: Show the path to the quest marker on the mission map
- **Max distance between points**: Adjust the accuracy of the path calculation (higher values are more accurate but use more CPU)

## Benefits

- **Time Saving**: Quickly navigate to quest locations with visual paths and double-click travel
- **Improved Navigation**: Never get lost on the way to a quest marker
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Clearly see the optimal path to your destination
- **Better Quest Management**: Keep track of multiple quests more effectively

This module is particularly useful for players who frequently do quests in unfamiliar areas or who want to optimize their quest completion efficiency.
