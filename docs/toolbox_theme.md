You can share these files with other players to give them your exact theme and layout. You can also edit these files manually if you prefer.

If you're not happy with your customizations, you can click the "Restore Default" button in the Theme Settings to revert to the default GWToolbox++ theme.

This module is perfect for players who want to personalize their GWToolbox++ experience or who need specific visual adjustments for better usability.
