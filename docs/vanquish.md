# Vanquish Widget

The Vanquish Widget in GWToolbox++ provides a simple but effective display of your vanquishing progress in Hard Mode explorable areas, making it easier to track your progress toward the Vanquisher title.

## Features

### Vanquish Counter
- Displays the number of foes killed and the total number of foes in the area
- Shows your progress in a clean, easy-to-read format
- Only appears in Hard Mode explorable areas where vanquishing is possible

### Chat Announcement
- Ctrl+click on the widget to announce your vanquish progress in party chat
- Automatically formats the message with proper grammar (e.g., "1 foe" vs. "2 foes")
- Helps coordinate with party members during vanquishing runs

## Usage

The Vanquish Widget appears automatically when you enter a Hard Mode explorable area. It displays:

1. The word "Vanquished" as a header
2. A counter showing "X / Y" where:
   - X is the number of foes you've already killed
   - Y is the total number of foes in the area (killed + remaining)

To announce your progress to your party:
1. Hold down the Ctrl key
2. Click anywhere on the Vanquish Widget
3. A message will be sent to party chat with your current progress

## Benefits

- **Convenience**: See your vanquish progress at a glance without opening the mission map
- **Clarity**: Know exactly how many foes remain to complete the vanquish
- **Coordination**: Easily share progress with party members
- **Tracking**: Monitor your progress toward the Vanquisher title

This widget is particularly useful for players working on the Vanquisher title, which requires vanquishing all explorable areas in each campaign in Hard Mode.

## Notes

- The widget is only visible in Hard Mode explorable areas
- The widget will not appear in areas that don't have foes to vanquish
- The total foe count is provided by the game and includes all foes that spawn naturally in the area
