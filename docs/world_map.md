# World Map

The World Map widget in GWToolbox++ enhances the standard Guild Wars world map with additional features and functionality.

## Features

### Map Visibility
- **Show all areas**: Reveals all explorable areas and outposts on the world map, including those you haven't yet discovered
- **Hard mode toggle**: Quickly switch between normal and hard mode directly from the world map (only available in outposts)

### Quest Markers
- **Show all quest markers**: Display markers for all quests in your quest log, not just the active one
- **Quest marker colors**: Apply custom color overlays to quest markers to distinguish between active and other quests
- **Quest information**: Hover over quest markers to see the quest name
- **Quest context menu**: Right-click on quest markers to:
  - Set the quest as active
  - Travel to the nearest outpost
  - Open the Guild Wars Wiki page for that quest

### Custom Markers
- **Place custom markers**: Right-click anywhere on the world map to place a custom marker
- **Remove markers**: Right-click and select "Remove Marker" to remove a custom marker

### Minimap Integration
- **Show minimap lines**: Display custom lines created in the GWToolbox++ minimap on the world map
- **Coordinate display**: See the coordinates of any location when right-clicking on the map

## Usage

The World Map widget appears as a small control panel in the top-left corner of the world map when the map is open. From this panel, you can:

1. Toggle showing all areas on the map
2. Toggle hard mode (in outposts)
3. Toggle showing all quest markers
4. Toggle showing minimap lines
5. Toggle and customize quest marker colors

To interact with the map:
- **Right-click** on any location to see coordinates and place/remove markers
- **Right-click** on quest markers to access the quest context menu
- **Hover** over quest markers to see quest names

## Notes

- The "Show all areas" feature is particularly useful for cartography titles, as it reveals unexplored areas
- Custom markers persist between game sessions
- The widget is only visible when the world map is open

This widget is especially helpful for players working on cartography titles, managing multiple quests, or navigating to specific locations on the map.
